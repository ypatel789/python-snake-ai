# Snake Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

## Using Pygame to create the game and PyTorch to create the RL Model

This project is the culmination of my learning of Reinforcement Learning, up until this point, using Q-Learning to create and train an RL model on the classic snake game. This project is based on the tutorial you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds).

The snake game was built using Pygame following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--nsd2ZeYvs).

To run this code yourself, download these files onto your local computer then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your Python environment to install the dependencies. Then just run the agent.py file and you should be able to see the agent playing the game and learning each time it plays.

## Further Notes

Looking at further research to optimize and improve the learning to get a better score, I have found that using RL for this problem isn't best suited as many different solutions are better optimized for this sort of problem. This was a great project to get my teeth stuck into RL and to learn the basics of how this concept works. In the future, I would probably look for a different problem that is more suited to RL and maybe apply some more complex techniques such as using an Actor-Critic method. For now, this was some great learning and I hope to build upon this learning soon.
